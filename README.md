# An Odyssey of Teyvatt Bishojo (Fan-made article based upon Genshin) (12+ content include)

An open-source fan-made novel about a several bishojo trying to cure Lumine's vampirism disease, while trying to figure out the secret of Teyvatt.
The story might seems nonsense - after all, it's my first attempt on such a complex fan novel. So, **fork it if you like**.

The story is started **over 20 million years** ahead of Teyvatt stories, by when human (**Khaenri'ah**) already abled to harness the power of nuke fission, they used a kind of nanomaterial to wrap Th-232 or U-238 (Pu-239), in order to make a less radioactive fission-material block(aka, **Energy block**), the nanomaterial also contains fluorescence chemicals to reveal the material left in the block.
Those block was later used on space ships to power ion thrusters to achieve interplanetry exploration, and of course, to power the **Field Tiller**, which was later named by Teyvatt as "**Ruin Guard**".
Field Tiller was meant to explore universe, drill underground resources, and protect themselves using **missile** while countering asteroids on no-atmosphere-planets.
